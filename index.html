                    Dorothy Vaughan
                </h1>
                <p>was the first African American Mathematician and Programmer who leaded the Analysis and <br>Computing Division at NASA.
                  She was the first Black supervisor at the NACA and one of the<br> first few female supervisors. Vaughan became proficient
                  with computer programming, teaching herself<br> FORTRAN and teaching it to her co-workers to prepare for the
                  transition. She contributed to the<br> space program through her work on the Scout Launch Vehicle Program.
